Distributed IoT Data Acquisition and Analytics

This project encompasses program code, a generated dataset, and the resulting research paper. 
The main components of the project are:

Task1: Animal Movements
The Task1_animals_movements directory contains the algorithm for generating animal movement data and visualizing their movement routes. 
This task is crucial for understanding and analyzing the movement patterns of animals.

Task2: Data Transmission and Movement Analysis
Task2 is divided into two parts: server and client. 
These components work together to execute and simulate the generation and transmission of the dataset. 
The server establishes the channel and transmits data, while the client receives and processes it. 
Additionally, this task includes the movement analysis of the generated data.

Task2_tools_server-socket: Handles the generation and transmission of the dataset from the server side.
Task2_tools_client-socket: Manages the reception and analysis of the transmitted data on the client side.
